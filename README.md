## Code Companion

- Coders and students often use the internet to see base algorithms that they are to implement in their code. We present an easy solution and shortcut to help every coder not have to screen the internet for their algorithms, a combination quick reference and algorithm library, on the userâ€™s smartphone. With multiple example code snippets for different programming languages as well as pseudocode and explanations for when to use the information, a coder would no longer have to search for what they need and would instead have it at the launch of an app, well categorized and ready to go. Targeting Android devices, we hope to appeal to a large selection of developers and students with a helpful and educational tool and an attractive, simple to use GUI. Simply look through the listed algorithms or conduct a quick search if you know exactly what you need and have it readily at your fingertips.


### Post Sprint 3 Status: [Code Companion]

#### Built With

* [AndroidStudio](https://developer.android.com) - Povides the fastest tools for building apps on every type of Android device.
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - For realtime database and Authenticating users simply and securely.


#### Authors

 - `Immanuel` created a log-in/sign-up interface to greet the user when the app is first opened. This feature gives us the ability to expand the usability of the app through user-specific settings and saved items.
 - `Damian and Immanuel` implemented a backend database that talks to the frontend login/signup interface. This was implemented using Firebase, which is a DBMS that integrates right into an Android app seamlessly.
 - `Charles` focused on increasing the app's aesthetic appeal by redesigning the looks of the GUI across the app and cleaning up the previos versions of the GUI.
 - `Patrick` worked on linking the login interface to the rest of the app after the user input is validated by the backend DBMS.
 - `Josh` focused on building and testing the java code between psuhes and merge requests as well as making sure CI was running a clean build after each merge.
