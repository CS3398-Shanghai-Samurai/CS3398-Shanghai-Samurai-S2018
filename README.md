Post Sprint 3 Status:
 - Immanuel created a log-in/sign-up interface to greet the user when the app is first opened. This feature gives us the ability to expand the usability of the app through user-specific settings and saved items.
 - Damian and Immanuel implemented a backend database that talks to the frontend login/signup interface. This was implemented using firebase, which is a DBMS that integrates right into an Android app seamlessly.
 - Charles focused on increasing the app's aesthetic appeal by redesigning the looks of the GUI across the app and cleaning up the previos versions of the GUI.
 - Patrick worked on linking the login interface to the rest of the app after the user input is validated by the backend DBMS.
 - Josh focused on building and testing the java code between psuhes and merge requests as well as making sure CI was running a clean build after each merge.
