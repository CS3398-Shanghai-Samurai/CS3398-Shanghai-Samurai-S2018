  - The preliminary mobile Android app for "Code Companion" has been built and resides in the 'develop' branch.
  - The first page when the user opens the app is the browse page. This contains a list of algorithms to expand and look at.
    - Each algorithm's subpage contains an english explanation of how the algorithm works along with diagrams or visual aids if applicable.
    - Each algorithm's subpage also contains code or pseudocode to help the user understand applicability of the algoirthm in practice.
  - The Search function of the app was implemented on the frontend, but will be plugged-in to the backend during Sprint 3.
  - The contact-us page has been implemented and appears to be working as expected in the emulator, but the app will need to be loaded to a phone to make sure this utility is doing what it is supposed to.
  
# What's Next:
  - Add JUnit Testing and CI
  - Clean up app aesthetics
  - Implement Log-In and User-unique interfaces
  - Design and Build a user Database
  - Link Frontend to database
